![Track Database Changes](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e44a33d6-bffe-49ac-a350-8cdd1d72d5ac)


This repository contains the code and resources for building a robust CRUD application using Spring Boot, jOOQ, and Liquibase. This guide will help you to move away from messy SQL by using type-safe database interactions and manage your databases using Liquibase.

## About this project

Are you writing Java code that talks to a database? Sometimes it can be tricky. You might write plain SQL, which can be messy and error-prone. Or you might use simpler tools that don't let you do everything you need with your database.

Here you will learnÂ about:

- Setting up your Spring Boot environment for jOOQ
- Configuring jOOQ code generation for your database
- Generating type-safe database classes with jOOQ
- Building a basic CRUD application with Spring Boot and jOOQ

## Key Learning Points:

*   Simplify database interactions with jOOQ.
*   Automate database schema changes using Liquibase.
*   Streamline CRUD operations with Spring Boot.
*   Write less error-prone code.

## Getting Started

1.  **Read the Article:** For detailed explanations and context, check out the full article on Medium: [jOOQ and Spring Boot: Build a CRUD Application with Liquibase Migrations](https://tharushkaheshan.medium.com/jooq-and-spring-boot-build-a-crud-application-with-liquibase-migrations-3bb7f6ad5a0d)
2.  **Create Database:** Ensure you have a MySQL database instance running. Create a database named `local_db`.
3.  **Clone the Project:** Clone this repository to your local machine using Git:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Heshan-404/springboot-jooq-liquibase
    ```
4.  **Reload Maven:** Open the project in your IDE and reload the Maven dependencies.
5.  **Run the Application:** Execute the `Main.java` class to start the Spring Boot application.
